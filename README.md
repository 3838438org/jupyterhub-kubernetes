# jupyterhub-kubernetes

This project aims to build a JupyterHub deployment for a Kubernetes cluster.

It also provides a way to provision a test Kubernetes cluster using Vagrant.

## Deploying the test cluster

**NOTE:** Notebook storage in the test cluster is ephemeral, and will not be preserved
when the cluster is restarted.

This project uses Ansible playbooks to manage the deployment of the test cluster.
However, there are a couple of limitations on Python and Ansible versions:

  * The playbooks require some features that were only added in Ansible 2.2
  * The playbooks must be run with Python 2 because they use the `b64encode` filter,
    which is affected by the introduction of the differences between `str` and
    `bytes` in Python 3

In order to ensure we are using the correct versions of Python and Ansible, we can
use a virtual environment.

To provision the test cluster, run the following in your checkout directory:

```
$ pip2 install virtualenv    #Â If not already installed
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install 'ansible>=2.2'
(venv) $ vagrant up
...
```

To access `kubectl` on the master, just use:

```
$ vagrant ssh kube-node0 -- -l root
[root@kube-node0 ~]# kubectl ...
```

To discover the port on which the Kubernetes Dashboard is running, use the following command:

```
[root@kube-node0 ~]# kubectl describe svc kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system | grep NodePort:
```

The dashboard will then be accessible via that port in a browser on the host, e.g. http://172.28.128.101:<port>.

When bringing the cluster up, the Kubernetes manifest files for the various JupyterHub
components are copied to the Kubernetes master (`kube-node0`), with some templating of
variables (such as `server_name`).

To start JupyterHub, these components must be started in a specific order:

```
[root@kube-node0 ~]# cd ~/manifests
[root@kube-node0 manifests]# kubectl create -f nfs-notebook-storage.yml
service "nfs-provisioner" created
deployment "nfs-provisioner" created
storageclass "notebook-storage" created
[root@kube-node0 manifests]# kubectl create -f hub-service.yml
service "jupyterhub" created
configmap "jupyterhub-config" created
deployment "jupyterhub" created
[root@kube-node0 manifests]# kubectl create -f nginx-proxy-nodeport.yml
service "nginx-proxy" created
[root@kube-node0 manifests]# kubectl create -f nginx-proxy-deployment.yml
secret "nginx-ssl-cert" created
configmap "nginx-conf" created
deployment "nginx-proxy" created
```

Once all the pods have started, JupyterHub will be available at https://172.28.128.101:31443.
